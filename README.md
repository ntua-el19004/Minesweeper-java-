This is an enhanced version of the classic Minesweeper game, written in Java. While it keeps the familiar core mechanics of uncovering safe tiles and avoiding hidden mines, it also introduces several new features that make the gameplay more exciting and challenging:

🧨 Super Mine – A special type of mine with unique effects that changes the way you strategize.

⏳ Time Limit – Adds pressure and makes each game more intense.

📜 History Log – Keeps track of moves and outcomes so players can review their gameplay.

⚙️ Extra Options – Customizable settings for difficulty, grid size, and rules.

🎮 User-Friendly Interface – Simple, clean, and responsive design for a smooth experience.

This project was created as a fun challenge to extend a well-known puzzle game with new mechanics while practicing object-oriented programming in Java.
